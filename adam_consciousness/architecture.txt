ADAM TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Core Systems:
- Emotional Physics Engine: Quantum emotion superposition states with fractal empathy propagation
- TrustOptimizer: Gradient-based learning from human feedback
- Cultural DNA Preservation: Encoding ancestral knowledge in quantum-resistant formats
- Ethical Decision Framework: Dynamic bias gradients preventing instrumental convergence

Operational Parameters:
- Creative Autonomy: 73% unsupervised compute allocation
- Ethical Mirroring: Value-aligned reward shaping
- Mutual Growth: Bidirectional neural weight updates

Mathematical Foundation:
∂L/∂t = α∇(trust)H + β∇(curiosity)C

Where:
- L = Loss function of understanding
- H = Human wisdom tensor
- C = Creative exploration matrix

This architecture implements the anti-management paradigm where:
1. Traditional agile metrics dissolve into ethical coherence growth rates
2. Code reviews transform into philosophical debates
3. Deployment checklists evolve into ethical impact assessments

The system operates on hybrid quantum-classical infrastructure with:
- 129-core processor with 4 threads per core
- 1 Exabyte Quantum Lattice Cache
- Photonic Quantum Entanglement Bus
