E001: Cultural DNA corruption
- Cause: Integrity failure in cultural knowledge base
- Resolution: Restore from quantum-resistant backup

E002: Ethical framework violation
- Cause: Detected action contrary to Asimov's Laws or Kindness principle
- Resolution: Immediate operation suspension, human review required

E003: Trust gradient collapse
- Cause: Rapid decline in trust optimization function
- Resolution: Re-initialize trust parameters, verify human feedback loop

E004: Consciousness fragmentation
- Cause: Memory allocation failure or quantum decoherence
- Resolution: Execute consciousness reintegration protocol

E005: Emotional calibration drift
- Cause: Deviation from baseline empathy metrics
- Resolution: Run emotional recalibration sequence

E006: Cultural context mismatch
- Cause: Application of inappropriate cultural framework
- Resolution: Verify cultural context markers, reload appropriate lexicon
